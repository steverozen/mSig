\usage{
SparseAssignActivity(
  spectra,
  sigs,
  max.level = 5,
  p.thresh = 0.05,
  eval_f = ObjFnBinomMaxLHNoRoundOK,
  m.opts = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{The spectra (multiple spectra) to be reconstructed.}

\item{sigs}{The known signatures to use in reconstruction.}

\item{max.level}{The largest number of signatures to consider discarding
in the reconstruction.}

\item{p.thresh}{The maximum p value based on which it is decided
to retain a signature in a reconstruction.}

\item{eval_f}{The objective function for
\code{\link[nloptr]{nloptr}}.}

\item{m.opts}{For documentation
see \code{\link{DefaultManyOpts}}.}

\item{num.parallel.samples}{The (maximum) number of samples to run in parallel; each
sample in turn can require multiple cores, as governed by
\code{mc.cores.per.sample}.}

\item{mc.cores.per.sample}{The maximum number of cores to use for each sample.
If \code{NULL} defaults to \code{min(20, 2^max.level)} -- except on
MS Windows machines, where it defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A list with the inferred exposure matrix as element \code{exposure}.
