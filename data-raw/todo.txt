To Do

* More tests trying to use AnySigSubset
 
 *** Clean up documentation for SynSigGen::GetSynSigParamsFromExposures to explain why there can be fewer rows than input signatures; 
 discuss w/ Arnoud -- do we need to test for presence of SBS2 and SBS13?  They are dropped if not helpful.
 *** Possiby remove similarity functions from SynSigGen?
 *** Do we need count signatures for
 Twinstrand opportunity?
 *** Typo GenearateSyntheticParameters --- missing bases *ON* given parameters
*** CreateAndWriteCatalog very out of date 

* Finish documenting AnySigSubset example markdown document, and test on some synthetic data 
  (probably in the markdown document).  Use Synsiggen to generate the synthetic data.
  
* Print and edit all documentation

* Test "Separate Background" on synthetic data based on real bacground and known PCAWG7 signatures

** Make synthetic data based on hepg2 background SBS40 is closest to background
SBS4, SBS18, SBS8 worth trying --- is there strand bias in nitrosamine spectra? Note:
ClosestCosSigDensity(nitrosamine.examples$catSBS96[ , 1, drop = F]) # SBS40



* Maybe later

0.1 Make synthetic data based on Kucab background

0. Test Kucab background signature approach  and compare to our approach.

1. Continue with OtherFunctions.R (currently in data-raw)

2. load taiwan.HCC.spectra.tsv and test "process.one.group" on it.

3. Enhance sparse assign signature to return all equally good exposure sets with the minimum set cardinality and look into -Inf likelihoods (SparseAssignTest5)


5. Clean documentation for SparseAssignActivity.

6. Bring over other code in old mSigAct.
