To Do

1. Bring over signature presence test.

2. Bring over other code in old mSigAct.

3. Provide a version of sparse assign signature that runs on a catalog of spectra

4. Enhance sparse assign signature to return all equally good exposure sets with the minimum set cardinality.

5. Test Kucab background signature approach and compare to our approach.

6. Move background subtraction tests to testthat.
