To Do

0. Continue with OtherFunctions.R (currently in data-raw)

1. load taiwan.HCC.spectra.tsv and test "process.one.group" on it.

2. Enhance sparse assign signature to return all equally good exposure sets with the minimum set cardinality and look into -Inf likelihoods (SparseAssignTest5)

3. Test Kucab background signature approach and compare to our approach.

4. Move background subtraction tests to testthat.

5. Clean documentation for SparseAssignActivity.

6. Bring over other code in old mSigAct.
