To Do

0. Test Kucab background signature approach and compare to our approach.

1. Continue with OtherFunctions.R (currently in data-raw)

2. load taiwan.HCC.spectra.tsv and test "process.one.group" on it.

3. Enhance sparse assign signature to return all equally good exposure sets with the minimum set cardinality and look into -Inf likelihoods (SparseAssignTest5)

4. Move background subtraction tests to testthat.

5. Clean documentation for SparseAssignActivity.

6. Bring over other code in old mSigAct.
