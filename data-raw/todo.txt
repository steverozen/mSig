To Do

* Finish documenting AnySigSubset present and do example

* Test "Separate Background" on synthetic data based on real bacground and known PCAWG7 signatures

** Make synthetic data based on hepg2 background SBS40 is closest to background
SBS4, SBS18, SBS8 worth trying --- is there strand bias in nitrosamine spectra?

*** ClosestCosSigDensity(nitrosamine.examples$catSBS96[ , 1, drop = F]) # SBS40



* Maybe later

0.1 Make synthetic data based on Kucab background

0. Test Kucab background signature approach  and compare to our approach.

1. Continue with OtherFunctions.R (currently in data-raw)

2. load taiwan.HCC.spectra.tsv and test "process.one.group" on it.

3. Enhance sparse assign signature to return all equally good exposure sets with the minimum set cardinality and look into -Inf likelihoods (SparseAssignTest5)


5. Clean documentation for SparseAssignActivity.

6. Bring over other code in old mSigAct.
