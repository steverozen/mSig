To Do

* Make synthetic data based on hepg2 background SBS40 is closest to background
SBS4, SBS18, SBS8 worth trying --- is there strand bias in nitrosamine spectra?

* Get hepg2 nitrosamine data -- what is the closest signature -- mix this with hepg2 background for synthetic data

for (i in 1:)


0.1 Make synthetic data based on Kucab background

0. Test Kucab background signature approach  and compare to our approach.
0.01 more clean up; more simple tests

try initial estimate of bg propition max(bg.mut.proportion / spec.mut.proportion), then simply subtract

0.11 Figure out which optimization is best (global vs local? try on cluster!)
0.2 Test our approach on data in 0.1
0.3 Test Kucab approach on data in 0.1


1. Continue with OtherFunctions.R (currently in data-raw)

2. load taiwan.HCC.spectra.tsv and test "process.one.group" on it.

3. Enhance sparse assign signature to return all equally good exposure sets with the minimum set cardinality and look into -Inf likelihoods (SparseAssignTest5)

4. Move background subtraction tests to testthat.

5. Clean documentation for SparseAssignActivity.

6. Bring over other code in old mSigAct.
