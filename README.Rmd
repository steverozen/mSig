Analyze the the "activities" of mutational signatures in one or
more mutational spectra.
'mSigAct' stands for **m**utational **Sig**nature
**Act**ivity. 
mSigAct can estimate (conservatively)
whether there is evidence
that a particular mutational signature is present in a spectrum and can
determine a minimal subset of signatures needed to plausibly reconstruct an
observed spectrum.

## Purpose

The concepts behind the code
are described in Ng et al., 2017, "Aristolochic acids and their derivatives are widely 
implicated in liver cancers in Taiwan and throughout Asia", Science Translational Medicine 2017
<https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aan6446>. 

## Installation

### Get the stable version

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(repo = "steverozen/mSigAct", ref = "v2.0.2-branch")
```

The alpha version used in Ng et al., 2017, "Aristolochic acids and their derivatives are widely 
implicated in liver cancers in Taiwan and throughout Asia", Science Translational Medicine 2017
<https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aan6446> is at
<https://github.com/steverozen/mSigAct/tree/v1.2-alpha-branch>.

### Get the development version

To use new features in the development version,
you can install mSigAct from the master branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/),
which may not be stable:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(repo = "steverozen/mSigAct", ref = "master")
```
