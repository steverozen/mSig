Analyze the the "activities" of mutational signatures in one or
more mutational spectra.
'mSigAct' stands for **m**tational **Sig**nature
**Act**ivity. 
mSigAct can estimate (conservatively)
whether there is evidence
that a particular mutational signature is present in a spectrum and can
determine a minimal subset of signatures needed to plausibly reconstruct an
observed spectrum.
