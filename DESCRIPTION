Package: mSigAct
Title: mutational Signature Activity analysis ('mSigAct')
Version: 2.0.0.9010
Author: Steve Rozen, Alvin Wei Tian Ng, Arnoud Boot 
Maintainer: Steve Rozen <steverozen@gmail.com>
Description: Analyze the "activities" of mutational signatures in one or
    more mutational spectra. 'mSigAct' stands for mutational Signature 
    Activity. mSigAct can estimate (conservatively) whether there is evidence
    that a particular set of mutational signatures are present in a spectrum.
    It can also determine a *minimal* subset of signatures needed to plausibly 
    reconstruct an observed spectrum. This sparse assign signatures functionality 
    is *deliberately biased* toward using as few signatures as possible.This
    package does not provide all-purpose estimation for signature attribution.
    This package can also separate out the activity of a background mutational
    signature from spectra generated in experiments (usually cell culture 
    experiments).
