Package: mSigAct
Title: mutational Signature Activity analysis ('mSigAct')
Version: 2.0.6.9003
Author: Steve Rozen, Alvin Wei Tian Ng, Arnoud Boot 
Maintainer: Steve Rozen <steverozen@gmail.com>
Description: Analyze the "activities" of mutational signatures in one or more mutational spectra.
    'mSigAct' stands for mutational Signature Activity. mSigAct can estimate (conservatively) 
    whether there is evidence that a particular set of mutational signatures is present in a 
    spectrum. It can also determine a *minimal* subset of signatures needed to plausibly 
    reconstruct an observed spectrum. This sparse assign signatures functionality is 
    *deliberately biased* toward using as few signatures as possible.This package does not 
    provide all-purpose estimation for signature attribution.
