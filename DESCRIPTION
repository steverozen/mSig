Title: mutational Signature Activity analysis ('mSigAct')
Version: 2.0.0
Author: Steve Rozen, Alvin Wei Tian Ng, Arnoud Boot 
Maintainer: Steve Rozen <steverozen@gmail.com>
Description:  Analyze the the "activities" of mutational signatures in one or
    more mutational spectra. 'mSigAct' stands for mutational Signature 
    Activity. mSigAct can estimate (conservatively) whether there is evidence
    that a particular mutational signature is present in a spectrum and can
    determine a minimal subset of signatures needed to plausibly reconstruct an
    observed spectrum.
